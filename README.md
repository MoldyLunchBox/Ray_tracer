this is a program that renders 3d objects using mathematical intersection functions.it reads input from a configuration file (object type sphere, cylinder, cone ...etc, its radius, position, rotation ...), and depending on where the camera is looking it will solve the intersection function to check if the object can be rendered on the screen or not.

to demonstrate, i took this screenshots, no textures were used during this renders.
